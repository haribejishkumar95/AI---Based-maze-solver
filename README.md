# AI---Based-maze-solver
This is my final year project during Grad.diploma in Mechatronics. Reinforcement learning algorithm is coded using python frameworks to create a virtual AI robot. Kivy platform is used to create the environment for the robot to move in and collect data. The maze is drawn in the environment for the robot to solve.
